# Investment for Wealth Creation and Retirement
I have come to a conclusion that my investment over the period of time should consist of:
 - Debt Exposure
 - Gold Exposure
 - Equity Exposure

## Debt Exposure
I understand that one should first focus on creating a Corpus in Debt Exposure as it will give him some sense of achievement. I am going to have mutual funds to cover for my Debt Exposure and primarily I will be investing in below categories of Debt Mutual Fund for different purpose and target
 - Liquid Funds
 - Money Market Funds
 - Gilt Funds

Once my Debt Exposure targets are achieved, I can see monthly interest(not exactly interest but gain) accumulating in my funds to give satisfaction to my eyes.

**Please Note**
- On Entry .005% stamp duty is charged
- On Exit within 7 days graded exit load up to .007% is charged for Liquid and Money Market funds, check with individual Mutual Fund
- In case of selling pressure in market, we may have to wait for around a week before NAV becomes stable and we do not sell at NAV lower than ATH NAV

**Taxation**
- No TDS is deducted
- If held for less than 3y gain taxable as per your Tax Slab
- If held for more than 3y gain taxable at 20% after indexation benefit

### Liquid Funds
Liquid funds are debt funds which invest in generally fixed interest generating instruments maturing within 91 days. Instrument can be Certificate of Deposit, Commercial paper, Treasury Bills and so on. These are good substitute for a Savings Account and generally give returns better than Savings Account. Their NAV do not fluctuate too frequently.

#### Investment Reasoning
 - Return better than Savings Account
 - No Annual TDS on return generated till exit is made
 - If held for greater than 3years eligible for Indexation benefit

#### Target
This is going to be used in my rainy days and in general not touched for my monthly expenses. Initially I intended to have 3 months of monthly expenses in Liquid Fund but now I have updated it to have 6 months of monthly expenses.

#### Funds
 - HDFC Liquid Fund
 - ICICI Prudential Liquid Fund
 - Nippon Liquid Fund

#### Strategy
SIP or Lumpsum as and when to reach target

*Illustration: At current rate approximately INR 400,000 will generate INR 1,000 on monthly basis*

### Money Market Funds
These are similar to Liquid Funds with instrument maturing within 365 days and hence gives somewhat better returns than Liquid Funds and are good substitute for FD or RD. Their NAV do not fluctuate too frequently.

#### Investment Reasoning
 - Return better than FD, RD
 - No Annual TDS on return generated till exit is made
 - If held for greater than 3years eligible for Indexation benefit

#### Target
This is going to meet my unforeseen emergency expenses. Initially I intended to have around 6 months of salary in Money Market Fund but now I have updated it to have one year of salary.

#### Funds
 - HDFC Money Market Fund
 - ICIC Prudential Money Market Fund
 - Nippon India Money Market Fund

#### Strategy
 SIP or Lumpsum as and when to reach target

*Illustration: At current rate approximately INR 11,00,000 will generate INR 5,000 on monthly basis*

### Gilt Funds
These are debt funds investing in fixed interest Central and State Government Securities. These suffer from interest rate risk ie NAV drops sharply during increasing interest rate regime. There is fluctuation in NAV. In large tenure it is going to give return better than Liquid and Money Market fund.

#### Investment Reasoning
 - Safe bet
 - Better return up to 12% CAGR in long term

#### Target
I have not set as such any target for Gilt Funds but hope to have investment more than Money Market Fund in Gilt Fund

#### Funds
 - Nippon India Gilt Securities Fund

#### Strategy
 - SIP
 - Lumpsum as and when there is drop in NAV to average out

*Illustration: No fixed monthly gain, but @10% CAGR it is INR 10,000 monthly for INR 12,00,000*

## Gold Exposure
Gold is best hedge against all kind of Risk and is darling for all the females. Its price fluctuate a lot, so averaging is required to gain substantially over a period of time. In general Gold and Market are inversely proportional ie, in general Gold prices rally when market goes down.

There are multiple vehicles to invest in Gold, and some of them are:
 - Sovereign Gold Bonds(SGB)
 - Gold ETF
 - Gold Mutual Funds
 - Gold Wallets
 - Physical Gold

After analysing all the options listed above I came to a conclusion that I will be investing 1g at an average per month in SGB tranche as and when it is open
Any extra money I want to invest in Gold when SGB is not open will go to Gold ETF(GOLDBEES)
